The application currently exposes JPA entity objects directly through REST controllers, which creates several problems:
1. Security concerns due to exposing internal data structure
2. Tight coupling between API contract and database schema
3. Performance issues with lazy loading
4. Stack overflow errors due to circular references between Account and Transaction entities during JSON serialization

To resolve these issues, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) should be implemented to:
- Create separate objects for API responses
- Break circular dependencies
- Control exactly what data is exposed to clients
- Improve performance by fetching only necessary data

Run the application and send sample requests and ensure the issue is resolved.
